- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator (for testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flow-focus.git
cd flow-focus
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

## üìä App Architecture

### State Management
The app uses Zustand for state management with the following stores:
- `pomodoroStore` - Timer state and flow metrics
- `settingsStore` - User preferences and configuration
- `statisticsStore` - Usage analytics and historical data
- `goalsStore` - Goal tracking and achievement system
- `themeStore` - Theme customization and appearance

### Database Schema
SQLite database with the following main tables:
- `goals` - User goals and progress tracking
- `statistics` - Daily/weekly/monthly usage statistics
- `flow_metrics` - Flow state tracking and analytics
- `settings` - User preferences and configuration
- `theme` - Theme customization data

### Background Processing
- **Background Timer**: Continues timing sessions when app is backgrounded
- **Notification Scheduling**: Smart notifications for session completion and reminders
- **Data Sync**: Periodic synchronization of local data
